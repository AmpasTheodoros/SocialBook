# SocialBook

This repository contains a social networking website called "SocialBook". The website allows users to create an account, make posts, and interact with other users through likes, comments, and friend requests.

## Getting Started

To use the website, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- The website includes a homepage with a feed of posts from the user's friends.
- Users can create an account and update their profile information, including their name, profile picture, and bio.
- Users can make posts, including text, images, and videos.
- Other users can like and comment on posts, as well as send and accept friend requests.
- The website is responsive and will adjust to fit different screen sizes.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the website such as:

- The ability for users to message each other privately.
- The ability to search for other users and view their profiles.
- The ability to create and join groups.
